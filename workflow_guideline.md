# Workflow Guideline

This document outlines the standard development workflow and implementation principles for the CarPart E-Commerce Platform.

## 1. Development Workflow

### Developing in WSL
The project relies on Docker (via Laravel Sail). To ensure proper file permissions and performance, always develop inside the WSL environment (e.g., store your files in the Linux filesystem like `~/your-project-folder` rather than mounted Windows drives).

1. Open your WSL terminal.
2. Navigate to your project root directory.
3. Bring up the containers: `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
4. Access the app via `http://localhost`.

### Artisan & Composer Commands
Always run `php artisan` or `composer` using the Sail wrapper so they execute inside the container matching your production environment:
- Adding a package: `./vendor/bin/sail composer require some/package`
- Making a controller: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller SomeController`
- Running tests: `./vendor/bin/sail test`

### Node & NPM
Since your project is stored in the Linux filesystem, run `npm` directly in your WSL terminal:
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`

*(Note: Never run `npm install` from a standard Windows CMD/PowerShell if your project is hosted in the Linux filesystem to avoid permission and UNC path errors).*

### Database Changes
1. Create a migration: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_some_table`
2. Update the corresponding Model and Factory.
3. If necessary, update seeders in `database/seeders/`.
4. Apply the change: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate` (or `migrate:fresh --seed` if destroying data is acceptable).

## 2. Implementation Principles

### Thin Controllers, Fat Services
Controllers should only handle HTTP logic (Requests and Responses).
- **Validation**: Use FormRequests or `$request->validate()` for simple rules.
- **Business Logic**: Delegate to Service classes (e.g., `CartService`, `OrderService`, `InventoryService`).
- **Responses**: Return views, redirects, or JSON resources. Do not perform DB transactions directly inside the controller.

### Safe Inventory Management
Inventory is managed strictly through the `InventoryService`. 
- Always use `lockForUpdate()` within a `DB::transaction()` when altering stock.
- Never manipulate the `stock_quantity` or `reserved_quantity` fields directly from a controller. Use the provided service methods (`reserveStock`, `releaseStock`, `deductStock`) to ensure ACID compliance and prevent overselling.

### File Uploads & Duplication Detection
Payment proofs (and other user-uploaded images) must be securely verified.
- The `PaymentService` automatically generates a SHA-256 hash of uploaded files.
- This hash is checked against existing records to prevent users from reusing old payment receipts for new orders.

### Authorization
Do not rely on UI hiding alone to secure routes.
- **Admin Routes**: Must be protected by the `auth` and `is_admin` middleware. Group admin routes under a `prefix('admin')` in `routes/web.php`.
- **User Actions**: Use Laravel Policies (e.g., `OrderPolicy`) to ensure a user can only view or modify their own orders and carts.

### Frontend Integration
While the current application renders standard Blade stubs, it is structured to easily transition into an API.
- Keep data preparation logically isolated from view rendering.
- When transitioning to a modern SPA (like React/Vite), replace `return view(...)` in controllers with `return response()->json(...)` or use API Resources.
